            For many years soccer has been perceived as something less athletic people
            participate. Words like soccer mom is demonstrated how looked down this
            sports is. But in other parts of the world, soccer is a total sport. Kids in
            Europe and South America grow up with soccer. No matter rich or poor, at
            some point they played soccer, or know about soccer. Many kids in Brazil
            living in the slums dreamed to grow up becoming a soccer player, as this
            seemed to be the only for social mobility. Examples like Ronaldinho who
            grew up from the slums and achieved numerous glories in the world stage.

              Football comes from an early form of rugby and grew in popularity through the 19th
              and 20th centuries. Today, the NFL (National football league) has 32 teams across the
              U.S. and in 2017, made $8.16 billion. Needless to say, the NFL is very popular and has
              an almost cultish following, where committed fans attend or watch every single
              game. Even college football teams, such as our own here at USC, have huge followings
              and make huge sums of money from ticket sales, athletic apparel, and TV contracts.
